# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction – Regression & Classification

## 📖 Overview
This project involves training and evaluating **machine learning models** to analyze the UCI Heart Disease dataset. We implement **both regression and classification models** to predict:
- **Cholesterol levels** (Regression)
- **Presence of heart disease** (Classification)

The project includes:
✔ **Data preprocessing and exploration**  
✔ **Training models (ElasticNet, Logistic Regression, k-NN)**  
✔ **Hyperparameter tuning and visualization**  
✔ **Model evaluation using R², RMSE, AUROC, and AUPRC**
